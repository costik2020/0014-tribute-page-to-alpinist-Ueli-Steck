The project consisted of the first solo climb of the north wall of Cholatse (6,440 m) and the east wall of Taboche (6505 m).  </li>
					<li><strong>2007</strong> - Steck set his first speed record on the North Face of the Eiger Mountain in 2007, climbing it in 3 hours and 54 minutes. The record was lowered by Steck himself to 2 hours 47 minutes 33 seconds the following year.  </li>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>2008</strong> - Climbing Annapurna Mountain, he broke off his ascent due to an avalanche threat, but the next week climbed to assist Spanish climber Iñaki Ochoa de Olza, who had collapsed. Medical help was slow in coming and the Spanish climber died despite Steck's help.  </li>
					<li><strong>2008</strong> - Steck was the first recipient of the Eiger Award for his mountaineering achievements.  </li>
					<li><strong>2008</strong> - Ueli Steck was married to Nicole Steck in 2008. </li>
					<li><strong>2009</strong> - Ueli Steck was awarded Piolet d'Or for his new route on Tengkampoche north face Mountain with Simon Anthamatten </li>
					<li><strong>2010</strong> - Ueli Steck was awarded Karl Unterkircher Award for his climbing versatility </li>
					<li><strong>2013</strong> - Steck soloed the Lafaille route on the South Face of Annapurna Mountain. on the main and highest part of the face; this was his third attempt on the route and has been called "one of the most impressive Himalayan climbs in history", with Steck taking 28 hours to make the trip from Base Camp to summit and back again. The veracity of his claim has been challenged. The face had previously been climbed by the 1970 British Annapurna South Face expedition using siege tactics and taking nearly two months. Steck's was the first solo ascent of Annapurna Mountain, which won him his second Piolet d'Or. Award  </li>

Later that year Steck set a new record for the North Face of the Eiger Mountain, soloing it in 2 hours 22 minutes and 50 seconds.  </li>

					<p>"The more experience you have, the more you can push those boundaries. Ueli Steck, I’m absolutely certain, had a very strong inner drive to keep pushing. He set very high standards for himself.
					He was always moving with immense precision and a sense of safety. Still, an element of risk will always remain in climbing a mountain."
